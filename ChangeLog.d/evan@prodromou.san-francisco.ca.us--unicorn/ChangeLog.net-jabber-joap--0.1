    Summary:
      Adding logging functionality to JOAP Server
    Revision:
      net-jabber-joap--0.1--patch-63

    Added a bit of logging functionality to the server. It's kind of simplistic,
    but it summarizes all the verbs as well as to's, from's, etc.

    Summary:
      Added test for server iq routing
    Revision:
      net-jabber-joap--0.1--patch-62

    Added a test for JOAP Server routing of JOAP messages. 
    
    This required breaking up the on_joap method into two methods: one that
    routes the IQ to the right destination, and one that resends the results, if
    any, and logs the IQ.

    Summary:
      Tested having a server advertise a class
    Revision:
      net-jabber-joap--0.1--patch-61

    Added a class (MyPerson) to MyServer. Had to mod the Server library a bit so
    the addresses came out right, but otherwise everything was fine.

    Summary:
      Test for JOAP Server Class subclass method handling
    Revision:
      net-jabber-joap--0.1--patch-60

    Added a test to check class method handling. Had to make some changes to the
    Object and Class classes to allow validation overloading, but it looks OK.
    
    Also, fixed a typo in instance method handling.

    Revision:
      net-jabber-joap--0.1--patch-59

    Added a class method to MyPerson to make sure that we could call class
    methods on instances.

    Summary:
      Made instance tests create a 'real' instance
    Revision:
      net-jabber-joap--0.1--patch-56

    Some of the server instance tests were just using 'new' to create a new
    instance. Changed this to actually use Class handling of an <add> verb, then
    get(), to get a 'real' instance.

      Cleaned up some bad copy-and-pasted addresses
    Revision:
      net-jabber-joap--0.1--patch-55

    I cleaned up some copy-and-pasted addresses in the test files. They weren't
    crucial, but they needed to be changed.

    Revision:
      net-jabber-joap--0.1--patch-53

    Added a test for JOAP Server Class subclass instance <edit> handling.
    
    Had to change the on_edit method in Class to make this work, as it wasn't
    doing the right thing with ID edits.

    Summary:
      Optimization of automatic accessors
    Revision:
      net-jabber-joap--0.1--patch-52

    Changed the automatic accessors to use the name of the accessor rather than
    a pointer returned by "can". This means that the accessor is created,
    compiled, and installed in the package the first time it's called, and
    thenceforth is just found by normal package-search.
    
    This seems to have shaved some time off the unit tests, but not terribly
    much (although most of the unit-test time is taken up in use'ing
    Net::Jabber!). Anywho, should be faster in real situations where running
    time >> compile time.

    Summary:
      Test for JOAP Server Class subclass instance <read> handling
    Revision:
      net-jabber-joap--0.1--patch-51

    Added a test for JOAP Server Class subclass instance <read> handling. Had to
    change how class accessors were created in JOAP::Server::Object::can, but
    that was OK.
    
    Also, fixed the age accessor for the MyPerson class, since it was, umm, wrong.

    Summary:
      Rump logging call
    Revision:
      net-jabber-joap--0.1--patch-50

    I kinda figured out how to do logging, so I threw in a call in the
    IQ-handling method in the JOAP::Server class. I still need to flesh out the
    log file format, but this is a start.

    Revision:
      net-jabber-joap--0.1--patch-49

    Test for JOAP Server Class subclass <add> handling. Had to do some tweaking
    of Class and Object to make this work, but it does (yay!).

    Summary:
      Removed extraneous main packaged decl in server tests
    Revision:
      net-jabber-joap--0.1--patch-48

    I started off with having the MyServer class declared in one of the first
    server test files. Then, I moved it to the t/lib/dir. However, the package
    main; declaration stayed in the test file, and through the magic of
    copy-and-paste propagated to most of the other test files for server stuff.
    
    So, I got rid of that. And I swear off copy-and-paste programming forever.
    Really.

    Summary:
      Test for Jabber Server Class subclass instance handling of <add>
    Revision:
      net-jabber-joap--0.1--patch-46

    In further pursuit of low-hanging fruit, I added a test for Jabber Server
    Class subclass instance handling of <add> (which should return an error).
    
    Additionally, moved the instance describe test file up one number, just for
    parallelism.

    Revision:
      net-jabber-joap--0.1--patch-43

    Added a test for JOAP Server Class subclass <edit> handling.
    
    Changed JOAP::Server::Class to validate correctly (return empty list, not
    undef).
    
    Added this test and class read test to MANIFEST (d'oh).

    Summary:
      Added test for Class handling of <read> verbs
    Revision:
      net-jabber-joap--0.1--patch-42

    Added a test for JOAP Server Class type handling of <read> verbs, and made
    changes to the code to make this test work.
    
    Added _validate_read and _validate_edit methods to JOAP::Server::Object to
    make it easier to add extra validation in subclasses (notably J::S::Class).
    
    Added _attribute_read_names to handle the sticky situation when a <read>
    request comes in with no attribute names. Defaults to return all attribute
    names, but the Class subclass overloads this to only return instance
    attribute names for instances, or class attribute names for classes.
    
    Lastly, the automatic class attribute accessor was corrected in the can()
    operator.

    Summary:
      Correct class <describe> test, added instance <describe> test
    Revision:
      net-jabber-joap--0.1--patch-41

    The class describe test was actually being sent to an _instance_ of the
    class. This is, of course, incorrect. I made the message go to the class
    instead of an instance, and made an instance test, too.

    Revision:
      net-jabber-joap--0.1--patch-40

    Added a test file for JOAP Server Class handling of <describe> verb. Made
    some changes to the Class.pm file so it properly timestamps describes.
    
    Also, added class attributes to the MyPerson.pm class to make sure that
    those existed.

    Revision:
      net-jabber-joap--0.1--patch-39

    Added a class to t/lib, MyPerson, to test JOAP server classes (and
    instances).

    Revision:

    Revision:
      net-jabber-joap--0.1--patch-37

    Test for executing methods on a server, using XML-RPC. Seems to work (yay!).
    
    To make this test work, added some code to the JOAP::Server::Object class,
    and also added a method to the MyServer test class.

    Summary:
      Initial testing of server objects
    Revision:
      net-jabber-joap--0.1--patch-26

    Began some initial testing of server objects, in earnest. These tests are in
    the 120servertype.t test file, testing a server that's defined as a type.
    
    Added some test files to use JOAP server stuff as a base.
    
    Changed JOAP::encode to handle undefined values in a semi-rational way, if encountered.
    
    Added a method to JOAP to copy one RPC value to another. Kind of painted
    myself into a corner with these, and I didn't like it, so I switched it all
    up again.
    
    Some other minor changes to get tests to work.

    Summary:
      Added and tested new reply() method on JOAP::Server::Object
    Revision:
      net-jabber-joap--0.1--patch-22

    It turns out that the Net::Jabber::IQ->Reply method is seriously ab0rken,
    since it adds in all the children of the incoming query object too. This
    wouldn't be too bad -- you could just use it and strip out the children --
    except that Net::Jabber::XPathRemove is seriously ab0rken if the children
    are of type "children".
    
    Anyways, I added a new reply method to make replying easier (or, in fact,
    work). Adding an error puts the error _first_ instead of _last_ in the IQ,
    though, which is kind of a pain in the ass but at this point unavoidable.

    Summary:
      Added first pass at JOAP::Server classes
    Revision:
      net-jabber-joap--0.1--patch-19

    This is the first pass at the JOAP::Server classes. There's lots of code,
    but it's almost entirely untested. I've just got one test to see if they can
    be use'd, so far.
    
    More testing to follow!

    Revision:

    The package names for classes were getting too long. So, I arbitrarily threw
    out the first two names. Now, there's just JOAP.

    Summary:
      Removed bogus <query> element
    Revision:
      net-jabber-joap--0.1--patch-13

    Changed JOAP.pm so that the unnecessary and unstandard <query> element is
    removed. Changed the tests so they don't use the <query> element, and
    removed tests that required providing args to constructors for objects at
    the <query> level.
